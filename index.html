            <h1 class="historyTitle">Unfolding SoHo</h1>
            <p class="historyContent">SoHo, short for “South of Houston Street,” originally was a residential area known for its Federal and Greek Revival architecture in the 19th Century. As the century progressed, it transitioned into a manufacturing and commercial hub, housing factories, warehouses, and textile mills that contributed to New York’s industrial boom. By the mid-20th century, however, the area experienced a plummeted immensly, with abandoned industrial buildings and a diminishing manufacturing base. This decline unintentionally set the stage for a major shift: in the 1960s and 1970s, artists seeking affordable, spacious studios moved into these vacant lofts. The area became an epicenter for the arts, attracting avant-garde creators, like Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Yayoi Kusama, fostering a vibrant community that led to SoHo’s designation as a historic district in 1973. Overtime, the unique cast-iron architecture began attracting high-end boutiques, galleries, and restaurants. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, SoHo had completed its transformation into a commercial and tourist destination, balancing upscale retail with its historic charm. Today, SoHo is known for its luxury shopping, art galleries, and lively street scenes, drawing visitors from around the world.</p>
